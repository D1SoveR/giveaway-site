                        <p>The Farseer Trilogy is a series of books by Robin Hobb.<br>It follows the life of FitzChivalry Farseer, a trained assassin, in a kingdom called The Six Duchies while his uncle, Prince Verity, attempts to wage war on the Red-Ship Raiders from The OutIslands who are attacking the shores of the kingdom by turning the people of the Six Duchies into Forged ones; a form of zombification which makes them emotionless. Meanwhile Prince Regal's jealousy and the indulgence of his own selfish whims threatens to destroy Six Duchies.</p>
                        <p>Generally a pleasant read, if you don't mind the copious use of classic fantasy tropes.</p>

                        <p>In July 1956 Egyptian President Gamal Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, causing immediate concern to Britain and France. They already opposed Nasser and were worried at the threat to maritime traffic in the Canal. This book traces the course of subsequent events. Together with Israel, Britain and France hatched a plot to occupy the Canal Zone and overthrow Nasser. Israel attacked Sinai, and Britain and France launched offensives throughout Egypt, but strategic failures overshasdowed tactical success. Finally, Britain, France and Israel bowed to international pressure and withdrew, leaving the Suez Canal, and Egypt, firmly in the hands of President Nasser.</p>

Providing a detailed breakdown of the armies on both sides and discussing the merits of the commanders and the ways in which these influenced the battle, Peter Antill questions why the Germans allowed themselves to be diverted from their main objective and concentrate such large resources on a secondary target.</p>

                        <p>It's a magazine about… art, I think? There's a fair amount of rather unsettling drawings (including doll-faced Lady Gaga on the front cover), photos, some poetry…</p>
						<p>If it strikes your fancy, help yourself to it, I've no clue what to do with it.</p>
