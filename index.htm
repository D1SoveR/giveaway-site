                        <p>The Farseer Trilogy is a series of books by Robin Hobb.<br>It follows the life of FitzChivalry Farseer, a trained assassin, in a kingdom called The Six Duchies while his uncle, Prince Verity, attempts to wage war on the Red-Ship Raiders from The OutIslands who are attacking the shores of the kingdom by turning the people of the Six Duchies into Forged ones; a form of zombification which makes them emotionless. Meanwhile Prince Regal's jealousy and the indulgence of his own selfish whims threatens to destroy Six Duchies.</p>
                        <p>Generally a pleasant read, if you don't mind the copoius use of classic fantasy tropes.</p>

                        <p>A thrill-seeking Harvard linguistics professor and an ultrasecret branch of the Catholic Church go head-to-head in a race to uncover the secrets of the lost city of Atlantis. The ruins of the technologically-advanced, eerily-enigmatic ancient civilization promise their discoverer fame, fortune, and power… but hold earth-shattering secrets about the origin of man.</p>
                        <p>Picked it up ages ago on a whim. If you enjoyed the kind of intrigue provided by The Da Vinci Code, you might find it interesting.</p>
